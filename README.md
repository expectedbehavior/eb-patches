# Eb::Patches

A collection of useful monkey patches we use in almost every project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'eb-patches'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install eb-patches

## Usage

In Rails, in your `config/application.rb` file, you selectively choose
which patches you want to be included.

Patches can be applied by using the following pattern:

   Eb.monkey_patch <class>, "<method>"

e.g.

   Eb.monkey_patch Float, "approx"

The patches are as follows:

1. Float
* `#approx` - check if about the same as another given number based on
float's epsilons - whee floats!

2. String
* `#methodize` - get a stripped, snake-cased, downcased version of the
callee
* `#down_under` - aliased to `#methodize`
* `#filename_sanitize` - get a version of the callee that is usable as
a filename on basically any OS made since Windows 2000

3. Date/Time
* `#before?` - is this time before another time?
* `#after?` - is this time after another time?

4. Net::SMTP
* `force_tls` - force TLS to be used, even for smtp services
that don't advertise it. *Note*: this will also cause the initializer
to be aliased so TLS can be enabled.
* `reset_tls` - call this to allow Net::SMTP to
automatically determine if TLS should be used. This will have no
effect if force_tls hasn't been included already since it doesn't have
any meaning otherwise
